/**

 * The values that define the location of the horizon for an observer at
 * sea level:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  -0° 50'    Sunrise/ Sunset
 *  -6°        Civil Twilight (default twilight)
 * -12°        Nautical Twilight
 * -18°        Astronomical Twilight
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Note that these values are related to the horizon (90° from the
 * azimuth). If the observer is above or below the horizon, the correct
 * adopted true sunrise/sunset altitude in degrees is -(50/60) - 0.0353
 * * sqrt(height in meters);
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Sunrise is defined as the time when the apparent altitlude of the
 * upper limb of the Sun will be -50 arc minutes below the horizon. This
 * takes into account refraction and solar semi-diameter effects.
